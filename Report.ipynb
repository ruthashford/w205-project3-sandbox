    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will demonstrate how to build a pipeline to enable a data science team to obtain valuable insights on game events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The latest mobile game in a game development company has three events:  join a guild, purchase a sword, and purchase a horse.  To enable analytics for these events and the metadata of each of the events, a pipeline has been created to allow analysts to access the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To start a virtual container is created leveraging docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "kafka is then leveraged for a singular topic called \"topics\" has been created to track the events of join a guild, purchase a sword, and purchase a sword.   A single topic is intentional to allow filtering.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A flask app is created to simulate a web app that allows events to be created and stored.  In the flask app, events can be triggered with the corresponding meta data and host information for anlaysis.  Values are saved in a dictionary in a single key to value to allow simplicity in reporting and scale.   Meaning, if additional values are added or exisitng values are replaced, the schema is easily adjustable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python script filters for each event have been created and submits separated event tables to hdfs depending on the event type.  Error handling has also been added to ensure events are added.  This approach allows the availability to quickly adjust each event.  For new events, a seperate python script can be created.  For example, if meta data is needed for swords the write_sword_events.py can be edited.  If a new event such as, purchase a spell book is needed in the future, a wrtie_spellbook_events.py should be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 script files have been created to save results in tables written in Hadoop.\n",

    "* write_sword_events.py  \n",
    "* write_horse_events.py  \n",

    "Meta data to each event:\n",
    "\n",
    "* purchase_a_sword: accepts color and quantity parameters  \n",
    "* purchase_a_horse: accepts speed, size, and quantity parameters  \n",
    "* guild: accepts inputs to join or leave the guild  \n",
    "* default_response: this does not accept any parameters and is run when the user runs a blank input  \n",
    "\n",
    "Meta data for the users when an event is triggered outside of events and user agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* timestamp:  information allowing analysis on when the event occurs.   Use this value for understanding state changes over time.\n",
    "* Host:  information for allowing analysis on the User Id.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each script is ran, the events are successfully landed into HDFS.\n",

    "horse_table\n",

    "Data is then queried through a tool.    In this example, presto is used for queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is then saved in parquet for querying to answer the following business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guild Stats - How many people are in the guild?   \n",
    "* Guild Stats - How many people joined the guild in the past year?   \n",
    "* Horse Stats - How many horses have been purchased by size?   \n",
    "* Sword Stats - How many swords have been purchased by color?   \n",
    "* Sword Stats - How many swords have been purchased in the past year?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are setup with a positive or negative quantity to determine the state (total value) of swords and horses and state of being in a guild.    To query the total, sum the quantity of swords and horses.   To determine the state of a guild, a value of +1 indicates in a guild and a -1 indicates not in a guild.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating Testing Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For unit testing, apache bench was leveraged to send batch records to create mock data into parquet and enable testing of reporting.    Scenarios of testing data was coded into apache bench, this approach ensures if 10 values were created we can expect the 10 values in the reporting/analysis.  A streaming script has been created called generate_data.sh file.\n"
